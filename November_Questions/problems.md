1. Consider a range of NUMBERS. If the NUMBER exists at the very end of its 
squared value, print the NUMBER. EXAMPLE: 
25 is such a number. 25*25=625. Hence 25 comes at the end of 625. Thus 25 needs 
to be printed. RANGE: Consider the range to be 10->999. Level: Beginner 
2. Title: Second Max of Three Numbers 
Write a program that accepts sets of three numbers, and prints the second- maximum number among the three. Example: 
Input Output 
3 
1 2 3 2 
0 15 5 5 
100 999 50 100 
Level: Beginner 
3. Given a positive integer n, imagine you have a special device that multiplies any 
number by the previous number you entered. For instance, if you input 2, the device 
outputs 2 (1 * 2). If you input 3, the device outputs 6 (2 * 3). Your challenge is to find all the unique outputs you can generate from this device 
using numbers less than or equal to n. Return these outputs in a sorted (ascending) 
array. Examples: 
i. Input: n = 7 
Output: [1, 2, 6] 
Explanation: 
- Entering 1 into the device gives 1 (1 * 1). - Entering 2 into the device gives 2 (1 * 2). - Entering 3 into the device gives 6 (2 * 3). - Entering numbers greater than 3 (like 4) will result in outputs exceeding 7 (our limit). ii. Input: n = 2 
Output: [1, 2]

4. Two strings S1, S2 are provided in lowercase. You have to check if both the 
strings are anagrams of each other or not. Two strings are called anagrams of each 
other if they contain the same characters with the same frequency. Eg: S1: hello S2: lelho 
Output- true

5. Title: Chef and Chocolates 
Statement: Chef has X 5 rupee coins and Y 10 rupee coins. Chef goes to a shop 
to buy chocolates for Chefina where each chocolate costs Z rupees. Find the 
maximum number of chocolates that Chef can buy for Chefina 
.Input Format: The first line contains a single integer T— the number of test 
cases. Then the test cases follow. The first and only line of each test case contains 
three integers . X, Y and Z — the number of 5 rupee coins, the number of 10 rupee 
coins and the cost of each chocolate. Output Format: For each test case, output the maximum number of 
chocolates that Chef can buy for Chefina. Example: 
Input Output 
4 
10 10 10 15 
3 1 8 3 
8 1 3 16 
4 4 1000 0
